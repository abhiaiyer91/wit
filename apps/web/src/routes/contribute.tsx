    prompt: `I'm contributing to wit, an AI-native Git platform. Please help me create a "5 minutes to wow" quickstart tutorial that gets new users productive immediately.

1. First, understand what wit offers by exploring:
   - README.md for the project overview
   - ROADMAP.md for the vision and features
   - docs/ folder for existing documentation structure

2. Create a new quickstart guide at docs/quickstart.mdx that covers:
   - Installing wit (once we have the one-liner)
   - Initializing a repo: wit init
   - The "zero command" experience: just running 'wit' to see smart status
   - Making an AI-powered commit: wit ai commit
   - Semantic code search: wit search "where do we handle X"
   - Opening a PR with AI description: wit pr create

3. The tutorial should:
   - Be completable in under 5 minutes
   - Show the "wow" moments - AI commit messages, semantic search, smart status
   - Use a realistic example project
   - Include screenshots or terminal output examples
   - Follow the existing docs style (check docs/mint.json)

4. Update docs/mint.json to add the quickstart to navigation

5. Test that the tutorial actually works by following it yourself

The goal: a new user should think "this is way better than git" within 5 minutes.`,

1. Study how other tools do this:
   - nvm: curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../install.sh | bash
   - rustup: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

2. Create an install script that:
   - Detects the OS (macOS, Linux, Windows via WSL)
   - Downloads the appropriate binary or uses npm
   - Adds wit to the PATH
   - Verifies the installation
   - Shows a welcome message with next steps

3. The script should handle:
   - Different shells (bash, zsh, fish)
   - Permission issues gracefully
   - Network failures with helpful errors
   - Existing installations (upgrade path)

4. Create the install script at scripts/install.sh

5. Update README.md with the one-liner installation command

6. Test on different environments if possible

1. First, get the full list of commands:
   - Look at src/commands/ - each .ts file is a command
   - Run: ls src/commands/*.ts | wc -l to count them
   - Check docs/commands/ to see what's already documented

2. For each undocumented command, create a .mdx file in docs/commands/:
   - Read the command source to understand all options
   - Follow the existing doc format (check docs/mint.json)
   
3. Each command doc should include:
   - Brief description (one sentence)
   - Full description with use cases
   - Syntax: wit <command> [options]
   - All available flags with descriptions
   - 3-5 practical examples
   - Tips and common workflows
   - Related commands section

1. Run the full test suite and identify failures:
   npm test 2>&1 | tee test-output.txt

2. Categorize the failures:
   - Look at tests/integration/ for integration tests
   - Check src/__tests__/ for unit tests
   - Group failures by module/feature

3. For each failing test:
   - Read the test to understand what it's verifying
   - Find the relevant source code
   - Determine if the bug is in:
     a) The test itself (outdated expectations)
     b) The implementation (actual bug)
     c) Test setup/teardown (environment issue)

4. Common failure patterns to look for:
   - Async timing issues (need await or longer timeout)
   - File system race conditions
   - Database state not cleaned up between tests
   - Mock not properly configured

5. Fix one test at a time:
   - npm test -- --grep "test name" to run single test
   - Fix and verify before moving on
   - Commit each fix separately with clear message

6. Priority test files:
   - tests/integration/pr-flow.test.ts
   - tests/integration/issue-management.test.ts
   - tests/integration/git-operations.test.ts

1. First, understand wit's value proposition from:
   - ROADMAP.md - especially "What Makes wit Different" section
   - The zero command experience
   - AI-powered features (semantic search, AI commits, AI review)
   - "Git that doesn't hate you" philosophy

2. Create or update the landing page at apps/web/src/routes/index.tsx:
   - Hero section: "Git that understands your code"
   - Feature highlights with demos/animations:
     * The zero command (wit shows smart status)
     * Semantic search ("where do we handle auth?")
     * AI commit messages
     * AI code review on PRs
   - Comparison with traditional Git/GitHub
   - Quick install section
   - CTA to docs/quickstart

3. Design considerations:
   - Use the existing UI components from @/components/ui/
   - Make it visually striking - this is the first impression

    prompt: `I'm contributing to wit, an AI-native Git platform. Please help me clean up the ESM/CommonJS module configuration to make the build more robust.

1. Understand the current state:
   - Check package.json for "type": "module" or "type": "commonjs"
   - Review tsconfig.json for module settings
   - Look at how imports/exports are done across the codebase
   - Check for .mjs/.cjs file extensions

2. Identify issues:
   - Search for 'require(' usage that should be import
   - Look for __dirname/__filename usage (not available in ESM)
   - Check for dynamic imports that might break
   - Find dependencies that only work in CJS

3. Fix the configuration:
   - Standardize on ESM throughout
   - Update tsconfig.json module settings appropriately
   - Fix any require() calls to use import
   - Use import.meta.url instead of __dirname
   - Update build scripts if needed

4. Test thoroughly:

1. Understand the problem:
   - Semantic search features use the 'ai' package for embeddings
   - On fresh installs, this might not be installed
   - This causes confusing errors for new users

2. Find where the issue occurs:
   - Look at src/search/embeddings.ts
   - Check src/search/semantic.ts
   - Find where the 'ai' package is imported

3. Implement a graceful check:
   - Before using AI features, check if the package is available
   - If missing, show a helpful error message:
     "Semantic search requires the 'ai' package. Run: npm install ai"
   - Or better: auto-install it if possible
   - Consider making it an optional peer dependency

4. Add the check in key places:
   - wit search command
   - wit ai commands
   - Semantic search API endpoints

5. Test the fix:
   - Remove the ai package and verify the error message
   - Install it and verify features work
   - Run the full test suite

   After: "Branch name 'my branch' is invalid - branch names cannot contain spaces.
          Try: wit branch my-branch
          See: wit branch --help for naming rules"

4. Create a consistent error formatting:
   - Use chalk for colors (red for error, yellow for suggestion)
   - Always suggest a next step
   - Include relevant command help

5. Test error scenarios:
   - Try invalid inputs for each command
   - Verify messages are helpful
